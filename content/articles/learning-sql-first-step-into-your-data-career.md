Summary: A walkthrough of my approach in learning SQL for data analysis interview and how I prepared for the learning the right way.

SQL has been around for many years and has become the ultimate standard for data folks around the world. SQL is the very first thing after Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel to learn before you begin your data career journey.

The reasons why SQL is needed for data is due to:

#### Majority of data is being stored in Database
Majority of data is being stored in database, many of the database technology out there using SQL as their interface to communicate with the data within the database. Understanding with SQL will help very much in terms of building out the data needed for analysis which often times involve SQL operation to be done.

#### SQL is important for data pipelining process
Apart from communicating with the database using SQL, data pipeline still rely very much on SQL as data pipelining languages. The transformation using SQL to build end-to-end data pipeline is a must for data analyst (_You can't analyze if you don't understand the pipeline, didn't you?_).

#### Simply, SQL is needed in the job portal
Outside the technicalities, we can't deny that SQL is the number one priority for many entry-level data job. It is not Python, it is SQL (especially in Indonesia). Therefore, understanding in SQL will probably increase your chances to at least pass the CV Screening process.
